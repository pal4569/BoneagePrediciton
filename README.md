Bone Age Prediction with SCN Model

This ML projected is intended to 

The project is divided into three main sections:

    Data Processing: Handled in serializeData.py, this section prepares the dataset for training and evaluation.
    Model Training: Conducted in model.py, this section trains the SCN model using the prepared dataset.
    Model Evaluation: Executed in evaluate.py, this section evaluates the trained model's performance.

Dataset

The model is trained using over 12,000 radiology images provided by Kaggle's RSNA Bone Age dataset. You can find more information about the dataset here.
Current Status

This project is a work in progress. While it is entirely functional, it is not very accurate, yielding unideal validation MAE. 

Requirements

To run this project on your local machine, ensure you have the dependencies listed in dependencies.txt installed.
